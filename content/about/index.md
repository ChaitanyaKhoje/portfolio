Hello! I'm Chaitanya, a data engineer based in Santa Clara, CA.

Shortly after graduating from [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/), I joined the data engineering team at [realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/) where I work on optimizing and orchestrating the flow of data thru the entire data architecture. 

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
AWS
  - Data Pipeline, S3, Batch, DynamoDB.
Apache Airflow
